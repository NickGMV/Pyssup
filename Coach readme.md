# Python-supplements-for-coaches
A set of supplementary session materials for coaches to assist with Python


The rationale is to facilitate targetted support for python with little to no prep for coaches
There are two sets of resources "BYOD" and "10 weeks of python" each targetting specific needs of apprentices regarding python.

## ==> BYOD series (targets projects and ROI directly)
3-4 sessions where apprentice that attend use the template and example pairs to try to build their own version of the project

Recommended Cadence: One topic per week runthrough twice 90 min sessions.

## ==> 10 weeks of python (targets learner support, additional practice, and individual study)
A structured bitesize refresher course for our python content sessions designed to be useable as delivery material or to support individual study

Recommended cadence: Two sessions per week 60-90 mins long OR use as specialised support materials during normal office hours/drop-ins
