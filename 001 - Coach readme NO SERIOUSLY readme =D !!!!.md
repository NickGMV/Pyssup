# Python-supplements-for-coaches
A set of supplementary session materials for coaches to assist with Python

The rationale is to facilitate targetted support for python with little to no prep for coaches
There are two sets of resources "BYOD" and "10 weeks of python" each targetting specific needs of apprentices regarding python.

## ==> BYOD series (targets projects and ROI directly)

3 - 4 sessions(Coach discretion) where apprentice that attend use the template and example pairs to try to build their own version of the project

BYOD series contains: Each week has a demo project prebuilt and code skeleton for apprentices to use
Recommended Cadence: One topic per week runthrough twice 90 min sessions.

## ==> 10 weeks of python (targets learner support, additional practice, and individual study)

A structured bitesize refresher course for our python content sessions designed to be useable as delivery material or to support individual study

Python 10 week course folder contains:
- Delivery sessions premade for weeks 1-10
- Apprentice project templates linked back to the weeks 1-10
- Assets folder (do not move)
- All notebooks work traight out of the box as long as the whole course is downloaded as ONE folder


Recommended cadence: 1-2 sessions per week 60-90 mins long used as a short delivery OR specialised support materials during normal office hours/drop-ins

## Other notes

- To help reduce planning burden template event descriptions are provided in the Coaches templates folder.
- Coaches can reduce burden of these sessions by rotating which coach runs the session
- Sessions have max 60 mins content, 30 mins should be used for apprentices to have time back or apply techniques using work data and templates
- This is the first iteration so may need edits/feedback leave comments on the github using the "issues" button
