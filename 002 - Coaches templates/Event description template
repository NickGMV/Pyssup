## BYOD sessions

B.Y.O.D (bring your own data) is a run of 3 sessions that directly link to applying joins, regression and time series in Python

The sessions will be 90 minutes and aimed directly at application with coaches on hand to help you debug.

YOU MUST BRING WORK/PRACTICE DATA TO USE IN THIS SESSION

By the end of each session you can expect to have an MVP(minimal viable product) to further develop outside the sessions

See you there,
